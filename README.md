# Modalize

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize)

**This package is still in an early stage, use it with caution.** ðŸ––

A modal that loves ScrollViews. This component had been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of scrolling and swipping behaviors you can face with a modal with react-native. This component is built-in with a `ScrollView`, you don't have to include it by yourself, just pass a View with your content, and the component will handle the rest for you.

## Demo

An expo app is avalaible at the [following link](https://expo.io/@jeremdsgn/react-native-modalize).

## Q&A

**Can I make a horizontal ScrollView inside the modal?**

Yes, of course you can. But if you use the one from `react-native` it won't work. You will have to import the one from `react-native-gesture-handler`.

```tsx
import { ScrollView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'`;
```

**What's the React modal's warning?**

In a future version of `react-native`, the `Modal` component will be moved out from the core. Besides, `react-native-gesture-handler` for `Android` doesn't work well with it. I'd recommend migrating to something like react-navigation or react-native-navigation's modal to wrap this component.

## Development

It's pretty rough for now, but it works.

```bash
cd example/
yarn
yarn start
```

Change the code into `example/node_modules/react-native-modalize/*.ts(x)`. Then the magic happens, copy your code changed and go to `src/*.ts(x)` and paste it. You can now commit and open a pull request.
