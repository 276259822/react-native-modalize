# Development

If you want to add a new feature or fix an issue, you can run the examples folder to test your changes. Each examples are using the local `Modalize` component from the `src` folder.

To run one of this example follow the [examples' guide](/EXAMPLES).

?> Don't forget to run the command `yarn watch:â€¦`. It will build the `src` folder and reload the example app you chose with the changes.
